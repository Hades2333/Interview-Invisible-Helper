## ðŸš€ Built for Myself. Polished for You.

This app wasnâ€™t made by a marketing team â€” it was built by someone who needed it.  
That means every feature was crafted with real-world use in mind. Every hotkey. Every setting.  
Every moment where you donâ€™t want your mouse to give you away.

No clicking. No waving your cursor around on screen. No obvious moves.
